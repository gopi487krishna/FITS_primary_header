# FITS Reader

**FITS Reader** is a small C++ API that allows manipulation of **Primary HDU** in FITS files.

It provides the users with a *clean* and *easy to use* API with support for *reading*, *writing* and *accessing* header data of FITS file.

**Note :** This API is developed as a part of GSOC Programming Competency Test for Boost.org under the Astronomy Section.

## Why should you choose this API ?

Developing APIs or libraries is a piece of art in itself. The traditional rules of writing applications do not work in the realm of API. 
**An API should be written in such a way that it is:**

 - *Easy to use*-  Programmer should not feel that he is using a third-party library, rather the API should seem like the  part of  the language's vocabulary itself. 
 - *Highly modular* - Low Coupling High Cohesion makes highly adaptable code.
 - *Adaptable to the needs of a User*  - "The aspects of design that have the potential to change in the future should be allowed to change and not fixed "
 - *Robust* - Should handle the errors and corner cases 
 
 and the list goes on.....

FITS Reader API has been designed keeping in mind the above principles (Please refer to the sections below for examples ) . It features 

 - A policy-based design allowing users to write and control most of the parts of Reader ( Things like adding custom rules, changing the way of parsing a value, adding support for parsing new types of values and so on. (This really comes handy when the FILE has been custom designed according to the needs of a User ).
 - No extra hassle to setup before reading fits files ( Just set a filename, reading mode ) and done that's it!.
 - Easy to use functions for manipulating and writing data back to the file
- Very few dependencies ( For memory-mapped files - boost )
- Conformance to the FITS standard
- Ability to handle both the fixed and variable format based data
- Good performance ( Mostly uses the standard library and boost instead of handwritten implementation for optimal performance )

## How to use this library ?

 - Download the latest [release](https://github.com/gopi487krishna/FITS_primary_header/releases) of FITS Reader library from the Releases Section of the Repository
 - Now unzip the file  that you just downloaded and
